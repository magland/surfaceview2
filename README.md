# surfaceview2

This web app allows you to interactively view 3D vector fields and surfaces embedded in 3D, and to share those views with colleagues. It is intended to be used with the [miniwasp](https://github.com/mrachh/miniwasp) project for simulating the optics of the eye of a mini wasp.

This app is [live hosted here](https://surfaceview2.vercel.app/), and is self-documenting. This project is a work-in-progress. If usage is unclear, please contact Jeremy or submit an issue on this repo.
